# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops


This project is a collection of C codes that demonstrate the basics of using functions and loops in programming with C programming language.

## Codes


* `0-putchar.c` - A program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

* `1-alphabet.c` - A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` - A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.


## How to use

* To run the codes, you will need to have a basic understanding of C programming language.
* You can also use a text editor, such as vi or emacs, to view the codes
      or just use the cat or less commands to the source code file.
* Use ./ before the fileName to execute the script.

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated the basics of using functions and loops in C programming language.
