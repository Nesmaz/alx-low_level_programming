# 0x00. C - Hello, World


This project is a collection of shell scripts and C programs that demonstrate the basics of C language and shell scripting using variables, expansions, libraries and comilers.

## Codes/Scripts


* `0-preprocessor.sh` - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor
                        and save the result into another file.

* `1-compiler.sh` - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

* `2-assembler.sh` - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code 
                     and save it in an output file.

* `3-name.sh` - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

* `4-puts.c` - A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle,
               followed by a new line.

* `5-printf.c` - A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar,
                 but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

* `6-size.c` - A C program that prints the size of various types
              on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* `100-intel.sh` - A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code
                   and save it in an output file.

* `101-quote.c` - A C program that prints exactly 
                 "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19",
                 followed by a new line, to the standard error.


## How to use

To run the scripts, you will need to have a basic understanding of the shell navigation and basics of C programming language.
You can also use a text editor, such as vi or emacs, to view the code for the scripts.
or just use the cat or less commands.

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated the basics of C programming language and shell scripting.
