# C Programming Basics

This project is an introduction to the basics of the C programming language. It covers fundamental concepts such as data types, operators, control structures, and functions.

## Resources

To learn more about the C programming language, you can read or watch the following resources:

* Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf 
* Dennis Ritchie
* “C” Programming Language: Brian Kernighan
* Why C Programming Is Awesome
* Learning to program in C part 1
* Learning to program in C part 2
* Betty Coding Style
* You can also use the man or help command to learn more about specific commands or functions, such as gcc, printf (3), puts, and putchar.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements

### C

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use system function
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### Shell Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash

## More Info

### Betty linter

To run the Betty linter just with command betty <filename>:

Run the following command to check if your code/doc fits the Betty Style (mostly inspired from the Linux Kernel style):

* betty-style file1 [file2 [file3 [...]]]
* betty-doc file1 [file2 [file3 [...]]]
